## üîß Installation & Compilation on Ubuntu

1. **Install GCC (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential
   ```

2. **Compile myshell:**
   ```bash
   gcc -o myshell myshell.c utility.c
   ```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Interactive Mode
Start myshell with a prompt:
```bash
./myshell
```

### Batch Mode
Execute commands from a batch file:
```bash
./myshell test.bat
```

The shell will automatically exit when the batch file is completed.

---

## ‚ùì Getting Help

### General Manual:
```bash
help
```

### Specific Command Help:
```bash
help <command>
```

### Examples:
```bash
help cd
help redirection
help background
```

---

## üìú Batch File Support

You can place a list of commands inside a text file (e.g., `script.bat`), and execute them like so:

```bash
./myshell script.bat
```

The shell reads and executes each line sequentially and exits upon completion.

---

## üîÑ I/O Redirection

`myshell` supports redirection for both **input** and **output**:

- `<` : Input redirection
- `>` : Output redirection (overwrite)
- `>>` : Output redirection (append)

### Example:
```bash
echo < input.txt > output.txt
```

### Commands supporting I/O redirection:

- **Input:** `cd`, `dir`, `echo`  
- **Output:** `pwd`, `dir`, `environ`, `echo`, `help`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Background Execution

To execute a command in the background (non-blocking), append an `&` at the end:

```bash
long_running_command &
```

This allows the shell to continue accepting new commands while the background task executes.

---
